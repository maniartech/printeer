/**
 * # Degradation Strategy - Graceful Service Degradation System
 * 
 * ## Purpose
 * The DefaultDegradationStrategy implements intelligent service degradation techniques
 * to maintain service availability and stability when system resources are under pressure,
 * ensuring graceful performance reduction rather than complete service failure.
 * 
 * ## Core Objectives
 * 1. **Service Continuity**: Maintain service availability under resource constraints
 * 2. **Graceful Performance Reduction**: Reduce service quality gradually rather than failing
 * 3. **Resource Conservation**: Minimize resource consumption during pressure periods
 * 4. **Automatic Recovery**: Restore full service when resources become available
 * 
 * ## Degradation Strategies
 * 
 * ### Browser Pool Size Reduction
 * 
 * #### Strategy Overview
 * Reduces the number of active browser instances to conserve memory and CPU resources
 * while maintaining basic PDF generation capability.
 * 
 * #### Implementation Details
 * - **Gradual Reduction**: Reduces pool size incrementally rather than drastically
 * - **Minimum Capacity**: Maintains minimum service capacity for essential operations
 * - **Resource Monitoring**: Continuously monitors resource usage for recovery opportunities
 * - **Graceful Termination**: Safely terminates browser instances without disrupting active requests
 * 
 * #### Benefits
 * - **Memory Conservation**: Significant reduction in memory usage
 * - **CPU Relief**: Reduced CPU overhead from browser management
 * - **Stability**: Improved system stability under resource pressure
 * 
 * ### Rendering Quality Reduction
 * 
 * #### Strategy Overview
 * Reduces PDF rendering quality to decrease processing time and resource consumption
 * while maintaining acceptable output for most use cases.
 * 
 * #### Quality Reduction Techniques
 * - **Image Compression**: Increase image compression levels
 * - **Resolution Reduction**: Lower output resolution for faster processing
 * - **Font Optimization**: Use system fonts instead of custom fonts
 * - **CSS Simplification**: Disable complex CSS effects and animations
 * 
 * #### Implementation Approach
 * - **One-Time Activation**: Prevents duplicate quality reduction
 * - **State Tracking**: Maintains degradation state for monitoring
 * - **Reversible Changes**: All quality reductions can be reversed when resources recover
 * 
 * ### Request Throttling
 * 
 * #### Strategy Overview
 * Implements intelligent request throttling to prevent system overload and maintain
 * service responsiveness for existing requests.
 * 
 * #### Throttling Mechanisms
 * - **Request Queuing**: Queue incoming requests when system is under pressure
 * - **Rate Limiting**: Limit the rate of new request acceptance
 * - **Priority Processing**: Prioritize critical requests over routine operations
 * - **Backpressure**: Apply backpressure to prevent request accumulation
 * 
 * #### Benefits
 * - **System Stability**: Prevents system overload from excessive requests
 * - **Response Quality**: Maintains response quality for processed requests
 * - **Resource Management**: Better resource allocation across active requests
 * 
 * ### Non-Essential Feature Disabling
 * 
 * #### Strategy Overview
 * Disables non-essential features and optimizations to conserve resources for
 * core PDF generation functionality.
 * 
 * #### Features Typically Disabled
 * - **Advanced Analytics**: Disable detailed performance analytics
 * - **Debugging Features**: Turn off verbose logging and debugging
 * - **Optional Optimizations**: Disable resource-intensive optimizations
 * - **Background Tasks**: Postpone non-critical background operations
 * 
 * #### Implementation Details
 * - **Feature Flags**: Uses feature flags to control functionality
 * - **Graceful Disabling**: Safely disables features without affecting core operations
 * - **State Management**: Tracks which features are disabled for recovery
 * 
 * ## Degradation State Management
 * 
 * ### State Tracking
 * The system maintains detailed state information about active degradation measures:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * // Check current degradation state
 * const isThrottling = strategy.isRequestThrottlingEnabled();
 * const isQualityReduced = strategy.isRenderingQualityReduced();
 * const areFeatureDisabled = strategy.areNonEssentialFeaturesDisabled();
 * ```
 * 
 * ### State Persistence
 * - **In-Memory State**: Maintains current degradation state in memory
 * - **State Queries**: Provides methods to query current degradation status
 * - **State Reset**: Supports complete state reset for recovery
 * 
 * ## Recovery Mechanisms
 * 
 * ### Automatic Recovery
 * The system supports automatic recovery when resource pressure subsides:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * // Reset all degradation measures
 * await strategy.resetDegradation();
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Gradual Recovery
 * - **Incremental Restoration**: Gradually restore features as resources become available
 * - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor system performance during recovery
 * - **Rollback Capability**: Ability to re-enable degradation if resources become constrained again
 * 
 * ## Integration with Resource Management
 * 
 * ### Resource Limit Enforcer Integration
 * - **Automatic Activation**: Triggered by ResourceLimitEnforcer during limit violations
 * - **Coordinated Response**: Works with limit enforcement for comprehensive resource management
 * - **Status Reporting**: Provides degradation status to resource management system
 * 
 * ### Resource Manager Coordination
 * - **Pressure Response**: Activated during resource pressure events
 * - **Performance Feedback**: Provides feedback on degradation effectiveness
 * - **Recovery Coordination**: Coordinates recovery with overall resource management
 * 
 * ## Usage Patterns
 * 
 * ### Manual Degradation Control
 * ```typescript
 * const strategy = new DefaultDegradationStrategy();
 * 
 * // Apply specific degradation measures
 * await strategy.reduceBrowserPoolSize();
 * await strategy.enableRequestThrottling();
 * await strategy.reduceRenderingQuality();
 * await strategy.disableNonEssentialFeatures();
 * 
 * // Check degradation status
 * if (strategy.isRequestThrottlingEnabled()) {
 *   console.log('Request throttling is active');
 * }
 * 
 * // Reset all degradation when resources recover
 * await strategy.resetDegradation();
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Automatic Integration
 * ```typescript
 * // Typically used by ResourceLimitEnforcer
 * if (resourcePressureDetected) {
 *   await enforcer.enableGracefulDegradation();
 * }
 * 
 * if (resourcesRecovered) {
 *   await enforcer.disableGracefulDegradation();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Impact
 * 
 * ### Expected Benefits
 * - **Memory Reduction**: 20-50% reduction in memory usage
 * - **CPU Relief**: 15-30% reduction in CPU utilization
 * - **Stability Improvement**: Significant improvement in system stability
 * - **Response Time**: Better response times for processed requests
 * 
 * ### Trade-offs
 * - **Throughput Reduction**: Lower overall request throughput
 * - **Quality Impact**: Reduced output quality during degradation
 * - **Feature Limitations**: Temporary loss of non-essential features
 * - **User Experience**: Potential impact on user experience
 * 
 * ## Production Considerations
 * 
 * ### High-Load Scenarios
 * - **Automatic Activation**: Seamlessly activates during high-load periods
 * - **Service Continuity**: Maintains service availability during peak loads
 * - **Performance Monitoring**: Provides metrics for load balancing decisions
 * 
 * ### Recovery Planning
 * - **Recovery Strategies**: Well-defined recovery procedures
 * - **Performance Validation**: Validates system performance after recovery
 * - **Monitoring Integration**: Integrates with production monitoring systems
 * 
 * ## Monitoring and Alerting
 * 
 * ### Degradation Alerts
 * - **Activation Alerts**: Notifications when degradation is activated
 * - **Status Updates**: Regular status updates during degradation periods
 * - **Recovery Notifications**: Alerts when full service is restored
 * 
 * ### Performance Metrics
 * - **Degradation Effectiveness**: Metrics on resource conservation achieved
 * - **Service Impact**: Measurement of service quality impact
 * - **Recovery Performance**: Metrics on recovery time and effectiveness
