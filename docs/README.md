## Preface

In the modern web development landscape, converting HTML to high-fidelity portable formats like PDF and PNG is a common yet surprisingly complex requirement. Whether it's for generating invoices, archiving web content, or automated reporting, developers often find themselves wrestling with headless browsers, fluctuating rendering engines, and resource management.

**Printeer** was born from this necessity. It is not just another wrapper around Puppeteer; it is a robust, production-ready utility designed to handle the nuances of web-to-print conversion with grace and efficiency.

This book is your comprehensive guide to mastering Printeer, from simple command-line usage to complex, high-concurrency batch processing and programmatic integration.
